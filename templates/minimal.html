  This is a minimalist HTML and JavaScript skeleton of the GoJS Sample
  <a href="https://gojs.net/latest/samples/minimal.html">minimal.html</a>. It was automatically generated from a button on the sample page,
  and does not contain the full HTML. It is intended as a starting point to adapt for your own usage.
  For many samples, you may need to inspect the
  <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS/blob/master/samples/minimal.html">full source on Github</a>
  and copy other files or scripts.

<div id="sample">
  <!-- The DIV for the Diagram needs an explicit size or else we won't see anything.
       This also adds a border to help see the edges of the viewport. -->

    This isn't a truly <i>minimal</i> demonstration of <b>GoJS</b>, because we do specify a custom Node template and turn on undo/redo support, but it's pretty
    simple. The whole source for the sample is shown below if you click on the link.
  </p>
  <p>
    This sample sets the <a>Diagram.nodeTemplate</a>, with a <a>Node</a> template that data binds both the text string and the shape's fill color. For an
    overview of building your own templates and model data, see the <a href="../learn/index.html">Getting Started tutorial.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Using the mouse and common keyboard commands, you can pan, select, move, copy, delete, undo, and redo. On touch devices, use your finger to act as the
    mouse, and press and hold your finger stationary to bring up a context menu. The default context menu supports most of the standard commands that are
    enabled at that time for the selected object.
  </p>
  <p>For a more elaborate sample, supporting grouping and tooltips and custom context menus, see the <a href="basic.html">Basic</a> sample.</p>

<script id="code">
  const myDiagram = new go.Diagram('myDiagramDiv', {
    'undoManager.isEnabled': true // enable undo & redo
  });

  // define a simple Node template

  // try getting rid of this part--the default node template will just make the node appear as the text
  myDiagram.nodeTemplate = new go.Node('Auto')
    .add(
      // two elements: the Shape will go around the TextBlock
      new go.Shape('RoundedRectangle', { strokeWidth: 0, fill: 'white' }) // no border; default fill is white
        .bind('fill', 'color'), // Shape.fill is bound to Node.data.color
      new go.TextBlock({ margin: 8, font: 'bold 14px sans-serif', stroke: '#333' }).bind('text') // some room around the text, bold font // TextBlock.text is bound to Node.data.text
